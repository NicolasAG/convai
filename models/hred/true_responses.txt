 <speaker_5> nothing , because that 's not what i 'm responding to . my point is fidel wanted the embargo to end for years but america wouldn 't have it . </s>
 <speaker_5> that wasn 't really fidel 's fault . the embargo was always more about the cold war than it was about anything castro did wrong . i think looking back he did a great job with cuba given the hand he was dealt . </s>
 <speaker_5> perhaps he had a change of heart after several dozen attempts on his life by the cia . </s>
 <speaker_5> in the beginning that was true , but they have switched over the decades . raul has been the one pushing for reforms since he took over . he has done things that never would have happened under fidel . </s>

 <speaker_3> well the us will be able to run more cia operations to influence the population and move against the regime easier now that we have a base in havana , so that is nice . </s>
 <speaker_5> the embargo is about more than just tourism you know . </s>
 <speaker_4> so cuban cigars will sell less as it is no longer taboo and they weren 't that great </s>
 <speaker_3> lol , yep , just think of all the change that happened with canada , the uk , and italy spending <number> 's of millions in tourist money in cuba castro is just teaching his slaves english so he can earn more cash </s>
