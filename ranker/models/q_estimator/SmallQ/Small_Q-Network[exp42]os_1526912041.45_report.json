(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. however, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "there are several theories to the islamisation process in southeast asia. another theory is trade. the expansion of trade among west asia, india and southeast asia helped the spread of the religion as muslim traders from southern yemen (hadramout) brought islam to the region with their large volume of trade. many settled in indonesia, singapore, and malaysia. this is evident in the arab-indonesian, arab-singaporean, and arab-malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. the second theory is the role of missionaries or sufis.[citation needed] the sufi missionaries played a significant role in spreading the faith by introducing islamic ideas to the region. finally, the ruling classes embraced islam and that further aided the permeation of the religion throughout the region. the ruler of the region's most important port, malacca sultanate, embraced islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of islam throughout the region as islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.",

      "article": "in england, the 16th-century european reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy. during the thirty-eight years of henry viii's reign, about sixty heretics, mainly protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably sir thomas more and cardinal john fisher, for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the church in england. under edward vi, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by mary i; even so two radicals were executed in edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying christ's divinity). under mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. when elizabeth i came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 act of supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \"...a subversive fifth column.\" the last execution of a \"heretic\" in england occurred under james vi and i in 1612. although the charge was technically one of \"blasphemy\" there was one later execution in scotland (still at that date an entirely independent kingdom) when in 1697 thomas aikenhead was accused, among other things, of denying the doctrine of the trinity.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",
