(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "there are many names for god, and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about god's identity and attributes. in the ancient egyptian era of atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called aten, premised on being the one \"true\" supreme being and creator of the universe. in the hebrew bible and judaism, \"he who is\", \"i am that i am\", and the tetragrammaton yhwh are used as names of god, while yahweh and jehovah are sometimes used in christianity as vocalizations of yhwh. in the christian doctrine of the trinity, god, consubstantial in three persons, is called the father, the son, and the holy spirit. in judaism, it is common to refer to god by the titular names elohim or adonai, the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the egyptian aten. in islam, the name allah, \"al-el\", or \"al-elah\" (\"the god\") is used, while muslims also have a multitude of titular names for god. in hinduism, brahman is often considered a monistic deity. other religions have names for god, for instance, baha in the bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith, waheguru in sikhism, and ahura mazda in zoroastrianism.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. however, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",

      "article": "when cowan powers and his family recorded their old-time music from 1924-1926, his daughter orpha powers was one of the earliest known southern-music artists to record with the mandolin. by the 1930s, single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music, most notably by brother duets such as the sedate blue sky boys (bill bolick and earl bolick) and the more hard-driving monroe brothers (bill monroe and charlie monroe). however, the mandolin's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man: bill monroe, the father of bluegrass music. after the monroe brothers broke up in 1939, bill monroe formed his own group, after a brief time called the blue grass boys, and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a \"parlor\" sound typical of brother duets to the modern \"bluegrass\" style. he joined the grand ole opry in 1939 and its powerful clear-channel broadcast signal on wsm-am spread his style throughout the south, directly inspiring many musicians to take up the mandolin. monroe famously played gibson f-5 mandolin, signed and dated july 9, 1923, by lloyd loar, chief acoustic engineer at gibson. the f-5 has since become the most imitated tonally and aesthetically by modern builders.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",
