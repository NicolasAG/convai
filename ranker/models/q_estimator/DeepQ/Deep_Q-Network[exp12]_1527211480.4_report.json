(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "there are many names for god, and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about god's identity and attributes. in the ancient egyptian era of atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called aten, premised on being the one \"true\" supreme being and creator of the universe. in the hebrew bible and judaism, \"he who is\", \"i am that i am\", and the tetragrammaton yhwh are used as names of god, while yahweh and jehovah are sometimes used in christianity as vocalizations of yhwh. in the christian doctrine of the trinity, god, consubstantial in three persons, is called the father, the son, and the holy spirit. in judaism, it is common to refer to god by the titular names elohim or adonai, the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the egyptian aten. in islam, the name allah, \"al-el\", or \"al-elah\" (\"the god\") is used, while muslims also have a multitude of titular names for god. in hinduism, brahman is often considered a monistic deity. other religions have names for god, for instance, baha in the bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith, waheguru in sikhism, and ahura mazda in zoroastrianism.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",
