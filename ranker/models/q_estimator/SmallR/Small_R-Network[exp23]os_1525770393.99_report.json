(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. however, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. however, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",

      "article": "in the united states, macabre-rock pioneer alice cooper achieved mainstream success with the top ten album school's out (1972). in the following year blues rockers zz top released their classic album tres hombres and aerosmith produced their eponymous d\u00e9but, as did southern rockers lynyrd skynyrd and proto-punk outfit new york dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. montrose, including the instrumental talent of ronnie montrose and vocals of sammy hagar and arguably the first all american hard rock band to challenge the british dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. kiss built on the theatrics of alice cooper and the look of the new york dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. in the mid-1970s aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with toys in the attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the american album chart, and rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. blue \u00f6yster cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by black sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album on your feet or on your knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, agents of fortune (1976), containing the hit single \"(don't fear) the reaper\", which reached number 12 on the billboard charts. journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year boston released their highly successful d\u00e9but album. in the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as heart released dreamboat annie and the runaways d\u00e9buted with their self-titled album. while heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. the amboy dukes, having emerged from the detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their top 20 psychedelic hit \"journey to the center of the mind\" (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist ted nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between ted nugent (1975) and his best selling double live gonzo (1978).",
