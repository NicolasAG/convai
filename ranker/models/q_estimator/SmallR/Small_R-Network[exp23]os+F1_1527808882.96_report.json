(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation. however, although the genetic sites are known, there is still much to learn about how these genes are expressed.",

(this is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) clement walker in anarchia anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s. james's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies.",

      "article": "notre dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in july 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in july 2014. the irish left the big east for the acc during a prolonged period of instability in the big east; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against acc opponents. in ice hockey, the irish were forced to find a new conference home after the big ten conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the central collegiate hockey association, after the 2012\u201313 season. notre dame moved its hockey team to hockey east. after notre dame joined the acc, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014\u201315 school year. there are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the fighting irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus francis wallace in his new york daily news columns. the official colors of notre dame are navy blue and gold rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. in addition, the color green is often worn because of the fighting irish nickname. the notre dame leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. created by theodore w. drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. the leprechaun was featured on the cover of time in november 1964 and gained national exposure.",

      "article": "in england, the 16th-century european reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy. during the thirty-eight years of henry viii's reign, about sixty heretics, mainly protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably sir thomas more and cardinal john fisher, for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the church in england. under edward vi, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by mary i; even so two radicals were executed in edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying christ's divinity). under mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. when elizabeth i came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 act of supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \"...a subversive fifth column.\" the last execution of a \"heretic\" in england occurred under james vi and i in 1612. although the charge was technically one of \"blasphemy\" there was one later execution in scotland (still at that date an entirely independent kingdom) when in 1697 thomas aikenhead was accused, among other things, of denying the doctrine of the trinity.",
