# file names
###

- starts with "full_data_"...
    means that we do not filter out 'non-voted' messages

- starts with "voted_data_"...
    means that we filter out 'non-voted' messages

- contains ..."_round1_"...
    means its data from the convai human evaluation
    ie: no `model` nor `policy` information (more on that later)

- contains ..."_db_"...
    means its data from the mongodb database, collected at McGill

Each file name has a time-stamp postfix.
This allow us to keep multiple copies of the data at different times.
Note that the data from the database will keep increasing over time.

###
# data format
###

- each .json file is a python list.

- each item in the list is a dictionary that has the following format:
{
    "R":         <float ; score for the full conversation given at the end>,
    "article":   <string ; article to talk about>,
    "candidate": <string ; response generated that we want to output>,
    "context":   <array of string ; messages sent by each person>
        [
            <string ; all messages sent by the bot before it got a reply>,
            <string ; all messages sent by the user before it got a reply>,
            <string ; all messages sent by the bot before it got a reply>,
            ....
        ], 
    "model":     <string ; name of the model that generated the `candidate` response. 'none' when unknown>,
    "policy":    <int ; policy id representing the dialog strategy used for this conversation (see `model_selection.py`)>,
    "r":         <int (-1, 0, +1) ; immediate reward of the `candidate` response>
}
