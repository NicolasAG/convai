2018-05-31 05:57:44,186: __main__: INFO: during the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the indian subcontinent, the carnatic wars, as the english east india company (the company) and its french counterpart, the compagnie française des indes orientales, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the mughal empire. the battle of plassey in 1757, in which the british, led by robert clive, defeated the nawab of bengal and his french allies, left the company in control of bengal and as the major military and political power in india. france was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support british client states, ending french hopes of controlling india. in the following decades the company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the british indian army, the vast majority of which was composed of indian sepoys.

2018-05-31 05:57:44,193: __main__: INFO: dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli. as the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years bce, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. as a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors. behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the otherwise humble domestic dog. these abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes. rather, these skills parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.
